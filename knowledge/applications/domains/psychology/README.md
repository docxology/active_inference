# Psychology Applications

Active Inference applications in psychology, cognitive science, and behavioral modeling.

## Overview

This domain applies Active Inference to understand human cognition, behavior, and mental processes. It provides a framework for modeling how humans perceive, learn, decide, and act in complex environments.

## Content Structure

### Cognitive Applications
- **Cognitive Psychology**: Mental processes and information processing
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Understanding human decision making and action

## Key Topics

- **Cognitive Processes**: Perception, attention, memory, learning
- **Decision Making**: How humans make choices under uncertainty
- **Social Behavior**: Interaction, communication, and group dynamics
- **Mental Health**: Understanding and treating psychological disorders

## Target Audience

- **Cognitive Psychologists**: Studying mental processes and behavior
- **Clinical Psychologists**: Understanding and treating mental health
- **Neuroscientists**: Linking brain function to cognitive processes
- **Behavioral Economists**: Decision making and choice behavior

## Connection to Active Inference

Active Inference provides a unified theory of cognition by:
- Modeling perception as Bayesian inference
- Explaining action as minimizing expected free energy
- Accounting for uncertainty in all cognitive processes
- Providing normative models of optimal behavior

## Clinical Applications

- Understanding mental disorders as inference problems
- Developing new therapeutic approaches
- Modeling treatment effects and outcomes
- Personalizing mental health interventions

## Future Directions

- Computational psychiatry and clinical applications
- Social and cultural psychology applications
- Developmental psychology and learning
- Integration with existing psychological theories
