# Foundations

Core theoretical concepts of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle.

## Overview

This section covers the fundamental theoretical concepts that form the basis of Active Inference. Content progresses from basic information theory through Bayesian fundamentals to the complete Active Inference framework.

## Learning Progression

The content is designed to be studied in sequence:

1. **Start with Information Theory** for basic concepts
2. **Move to Bayesian Fundamentals** for probabilistic reasoning
3. **Study Free Energy Principle** for theoretical foundation
4. **Complete with Active Inference** for the full framework

## Prerequisites

Most foundation content requires only basic mathematics (probability, calculus). Advanced topics may require additional background in statistics or information theory.

## Interactive Elements

Each topic includes:
- **Interactive exercises** for hands-on learning
- **Code examples** for computational implementation
- **Real-world analogies** for intuitive understanding
- **Common misconceptions** to avoid typical pitfalls

## Assessment

Learning objectives are provided for each topic, along with exercises to test understanding and applications to reinforce concepts.
