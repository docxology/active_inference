# Psychology Domain - Agent Documentation

This document provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents and contributors working within the Psychology domain of the Active Inference Knowledge Environment. It outlines cognitive modeling workflows, behavioral simulation patterns, and best practices for creating psychologically-grounded Active Inference implementations.

## Psychology Domain Overview

The Psychology domain provides specialized Active Inference implementations for cognitive psychology, behavioral modeling, and mental process applications. This domain serves cognitive scientists, psychologists, and researchers studying human cognition and behavior, providing computational tools for modeling decision-making, learning, attention, and social cognition.
