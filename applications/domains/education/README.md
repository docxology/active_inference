    'grade_level': 'high_school',
    'adaptation_strategy': 'multi_armed_bandit',
    'assessment_frequency': 'continuous',
    'learner_model': {
        'knowledge_components': ['algebra', 'geometry', 'statistics'],
        'learning_style': 'visual',
        'prior_knowledge': 'intermediate'
    }
}

adaptive_system = AdaptiveLearningSystem(learning_config)

# Initialize with learner data
learner_profile = {
    'student_id': '12345',
    'baseline_performance': 0.7,
    'learning_preferences': {'pace': 'moderate', 'difficulty': 'challenging'},
    'goals': ['improve_algebra', 'prepare_for_exam']
}

adaptive_system.initialize_learner(learner_profile)

# Adaptive learning session
current_topic = 'quadratic_equations'
difficulty_level = adaptive_system.assess_difficulty(current_topic)
content = adaptive_system.generate_content(current_topic, difficulty_level)

# Process learner response
learner_response = {'answer': 'x = 2', 'confidence': 0.8, 'time_taken': 45}
feedback = adaptive_system.process_response(current_topic, learner_response)
next_topic = adaptive_system.select_next_topic(feedback)
```

    'knowledge_tracing': True,
    'hint_policy': 'graduated'
}

tutor = IntelligentTutor(tutor_config)

# Tutoring session
student_query = "I don't understand how gravity works"
context = {'topic': 'newtonian_mechanics', 'student_level': 'beginner'}

# Generate tutoring response
diagnosis = tutor.diagnose_misconception(student_query, context)
explanation = tutor.generate_explanation(diagnosis)
hints = tutor.plan_hints(explanation)

# Conduct dialogue
tutor_response = tutor.generate_response(student_query, explanation, hints)
follow_up = tutor.plan_follow_up(tutor_response)
```
