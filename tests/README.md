# Testing Framework

Comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Active Inference Knowledge Environment. Provides multi-layered testing with unit tests, integration tests, knowledge validation, performance testing, and security testing.

## Overview

The testing framework ensures code quality, functionality, and reliability across all components of the Active Inference Knowledge Environment. Tests are organized by type and component, with comprehensive fixtures, utilities, and reporting.
