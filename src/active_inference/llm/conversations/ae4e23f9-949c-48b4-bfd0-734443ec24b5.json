Here's how:\n\n**Understanding the Core Concepts:**\n\n* **Entropy (S):**  A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.  Think about a messy room vs. a tidy one - the messy room has higher entropy.\n* **Free Energy (G):** A fundamental concept that tells us if a process will happen spontaneously. It's influenced by two factors",
