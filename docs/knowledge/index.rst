Knowledge Repository
===================

The Knowledge Repository provides structured educational content and learning paths
for Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle. This comprehensive knowledge
base includes theoretical foundations, mathematical formulations, practical
implementations, and real-world applications.

Overview
--------

The knowledge repository is organized into four main sections:

üìö **Foundations**
   Core theoretical concepts and fundamental principles

üî¢ **Mathematics**
   Mathematical formulations and derivations

üíª **Implementations**
   Code examples and practical tutorials

üåç **Applications**
   Real-world use cases and case studies

Learning Paths
--------------

Structured learning tracks guide you through the material:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   learning_paths/foundations_complete
   learning_paths/research_track
   learning_paths/applications_track

Search and Discovery
--------------------

Use the search functionality to find specific topics:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Search for specific concepts
   ai-knowledge search "free energy"

   # Filter by content type
   ai-knowledge search entropy --type mathematics

   # Find learning paths
   ai-knowledge path show foundations_complete

Interactive Features
--------------------

The knowledge repository includes:

- **Interactive code examples** with immediate execution
- **Concept maps** showing relationships between topics
- **Progressive disclosure** of complexity
- **Cross-referenced content** for easy navigation
- **Assessment tools** to test understanding

Getting Started
---------------

Begin your Active Inference journey:

1. **Start with Foundations** - Build conceptual understanding
2. **Explore Mathematics** - Understand the theoretical framework
3. **Try Implementations** - Get hands-on experience
4. **Apply Knowledge** - Work through real-world examples
