Bayesian Inference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probabilistic reasoning and belief updating:

- **Bayesian updating** and evidence accumulation
- **Prior beliefs** and knowledge representation
- **Likelihood functions** and model fitting
- **Posterior distributions** and uncertainty

Free Energy Principle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The unifying principle behind intelligent behavior:

- **Variational Free Energy** as a measure of surprise
- **Markov blankets** and system boundaries
- **Generative models** and prediction
- **Active inference** as energy minimization
